        <p>I was born to a family that love playing and watching football. I was raised up next to a ball when I was 3 year old. Growing up, my sport I picked to play the most was football. I could play all the positions in a 11 player team, and the position I was assigned the most to play was Centre Back. However, people always saw my appearance in the benchmark as I had so many classes and papers and documents to study.</p>
        <p>Why Centre Back? Because I played tough football, had a lot of possession and create chances. I would tackle the ball whenever I had a chance to do so.I would draw a lot of fouls just to make sure my goalie stress free and my goal frame remain nil to the end of the match.</p>
        <p>You may ask me what is the best match I have ever seen? Come click and check this <a id="football" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUTvglBTQ8Y&t=1s&ab_channel=UEFA" target="_blank">link</a>  to have a feeling of my taste of football mundial.</p>
