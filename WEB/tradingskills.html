        <p>
          I am very fortunate to have a strong background in finance and
          accounting throughout many years of studies from undergraduate to
          postgradaute in London School of Economics and Business in the United
          Kingdom. Therefore, stock, commodity and currency trading are like
          bread and butter in my life. Recently, I expanded my horizon of
          trading toward crypto currency exchange. I can day trade during power
          hours of the New York Stock Exchange market, draw Fibonacci lines and
          Elliot waves in stock charts, suggest hedge tactics for many long term
          investors to hedge their accounts when votality of the market increase
          or leverage their accounts when an upbeat sentiment is sensed market
          wide. My annual return is consistenly 40%. In light of market
          champions, I was lately approached by Citadel, Jane Street, and JP
          Morgan Chase to help build a better high frequency trading system.
