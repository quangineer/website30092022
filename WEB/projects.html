        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>Computer Science is a rocket science area for me. In order to master the coding skills, I have tried my best to program a number of small projects and put it in Github. Here I would like to present to you two of my self-considered great projects. I hope you enjoy it.</p>
        <h2>A Simple Calculator</h2>
        <p>I created a <a id="green" href="https://quangineer.github.io/Calculator-JavaScript/" target="_blank">simple calculator</a> for grade 2 pupils to approach a digital machine and make use of it for their exams. Please click on the green-highlighted text "simple calculator" to try and experience my works. This work is JavaScript based with fundamental HTML CSS.</p>

        <h2>A Digital Clock</h2>
        <p>Time is value. Time is pressure. I treasure it. I made a digital clock just to remind everyone to save time for good. Please follow the link by click <a id="green" href="https://quangineer.github.io/Digital-Clock/" target="_blank">HERE</a> to have a sense of what time is now. I hope after this, you can schedule your timetable appropriately for life.</p>
